# Stored Procedure 1: `GetProductRecommendations`

This procedure acts as a powerful and flexible product search engine. Its main goal is to find and rank the most relevant products from the `amazon_uk_products` table based on a set of user-defined criteria like category, price, and quality metrics.

### 1. Purpose

The primary purpose is to **dynamically recommend products** to a user. Instead of a static "top 10 list," this procedure allows you to find the "best" products that match your specific needs at that moment. It's designed to answer questions like: "Show me the best-rated, popular headphones under £150."

### 2. Parameters (The Controls)

The procedure accepts several input parameters, each with a default value. This makes it highly customizable.

*   `@category VARCHAR(100) = NULL`:
    *   **What it does:** Filters products by a specific category (e.g., 'Hi-Fi Speakers').
    *   **Default (`NULL`):** If you don't provide a category, it will search across **all** categories.

*   `@max_price DECIMAL(10,2) = 1000`:
    *   **What it does:** Sets the maximum price for the products you want to see.
    *   **Default (`1000`):** If not specified, it will only show products priced at £1000 or less.

*   `@min_rating DECIMAL(3,2) = 4.0`:
    *   **What it does:** Sets a minimum quality threshold based on star rating.
    *   **Default (`4.0`):** Only products with a rating of 4.0 stars or higher will be considered.

*   `@min_reviews INT = 100`:
    *   **What it does:** Sets a minimum threshold for the number of reviews. This is a proxy for a product's popularity and social proof.
    *   **Default (`100`):** Only products with at least 100 reviews are included.

*   `@limit_results INT = 10`:
    *   **What it does:** Controls the number of recommendations to return.
    *   **Default (`10`):** It will return the top 10 matching products.

### 3. Core Logic Breakdown (How it Works)

The procedure executes a single `SELECT` query that can be broken down into several key parts:

#### a. The `WHERE` Clause (Filtering)

This is the first step. It narrows down the entire product catalog to a smaller, relevant set.

```sql
WHERE (@category IS NULL OR categoryName = @category) -- Optional category filter
    AND price <= @max_price                        -- Price filter
    AND stars >= @min_rating                       -- Rating filter
    AND reviews >= @min_reviews                    -- Reviews filter
    AND price > 0                                  -- Data quality check
```

*   The line `(@category IS NULL OR categoryName = @category)` is a clever trick for optional parameters. If you don't provide a `@category` (it remains `NULL`), this condition is always true, and the filter is ignored. If you do provide a category, it filters for an exact match.
*   The other conditions directly apply the constraints from the parameters.
*   `price > 0` is a sanity check to exclude free items or data errors.

#### b. The Calculated Columns (Adding Value)

The query doesn't just return raw data; it calculates two new columns to make the results more meaningful.

1.  **`recommendation_score`**
    ```sql
    ROUND(stars * LOG(reviews + 1), 2) as recommendation_score
    ```
    This is the heart of the ranking system. It creates a balanced score by combining **quality (`stars`)** with **popularity (`reviews`)**.
    *   Multiplying `stars` by `reviews` is a good start, but it would heavily favor products with tens of thousands of mediocre reviews over a product with a few hundred excellent reviews.
    *   Using `LOG(reviews + 1)` **dampens the effect of a huge number of reviews**. The difference between 100 and 1,000 reviews is much more significant to the score than the difference between 50,000 and 60,000. This prevents older, popular products from always dominating newer, high-quality ones.
    *   `+ 1` is added to avoid an error from `LOG(0)` if a product had 0 reviews.

2.  **`recommendation_badge`**
    ```sql
    CASE
        WHEN isBestSeller = 1 THEN 'Best Seller ⭐'
        WHEN stars >= 4.5 THEN 'Highly Rated 👍'
        WHEN reviews >= 1000 THEN 'Popular Choice 🔥'
        ELSE 'Good Option ✓'
    END as recommendation_badge
    ```
    This `CASE` statement creates a user-friendly "badge" for each product. It evaluates the conditions in order:
    *   First, it checks if the product is a `Best Seller`. If so, it gets the most prestigious badge.
    *   If not, it checks if it's `Highly Rated`.
    *   If not, it checks if it's a `Popular Choice`.
    *   If it meets none of these criteria, it's labeled a `Good Option`.

#### c. The `ORDER BY` Clause (Ranking)

```sql
ORDER BY (stars * LOG(reviews + 1)) DESC;
```
After filtering and calculating, this line sorts the results. It uses the exact same formula as the `recommendation_score` and sorts in `DESC` (descending) order, putting the products with the highest scores at the top.

#### d. `SELECT TOP (@limit_results)` (Final Selection)

This is the final step. After the list of relevant products has been sorted by the recommendation score, this clause simply picks the top N rows, where N is the number you specified in the `@limit_results` parameter.

### Step-by-Step Execution Flow

When you run `EXEC GetProductRecommendations ...`:

1.  **Filter:** The database first finds all products that match the `WHERE` conditions (category, price, rating, reviews).
2.  **Calculate:** For each of these matching products, it computes the `recommendation_score` and determines the `recommendation_badge`.
3.  **Sort:** It then sorts this entire list of filtered products from highest to lowest `recommendation_score`.
4.  **Return:** Finally, it takes the top `@limit_results` from this sorted list and returns them to you.
