# Stored Procedure 5: `BenchmarkPerformance`

This procedure is a comprehensive analytics suite for measuring and understanding performance. It's designed to answer the question, **"How good is this product/category/price segment, really?"** by comparing its metrics against relevant averages and peer groups. It provides context to raw numbers like price and star rating.

### 1. Purpose

The primary purpose is to provide **contextual performance benchmarking** from three different angles:
1.  **Category Level:** How do different product categories perform against each other? Which are the 'Top Performer' categories?
2.  **Price Segment Level:** Which price points (e.g., 'Budget', 'Premium') are the most successful across the entire market?
3.  **Product Level:** How does a specific product stack up against the average performance within its own category?

### 2. Parameters (The Controls)

*   `@benchmark_type VARCHAR(20) = 'CATEGORY'`:
    *   **What it does:** This is the main control that selects which of the three analysis modes to run.
    *   **Options:** `'CATEGORY'`, `'PRICE'`, or `'PRODUCT'`.
    *   **Default (`'CATEGORY'`):** If you don't specify, it will run the category-level benchmark.

*   `@target_asin VARCHAR(20) = NULL`:
    *   **What it does:** The ASIN of the product you want to benchmark.
    *   **Usage:** This is **required** only when `@benchmark_type` is set to `'PRODUCT'`. It is ignored otherwise.

*   `@target_category VARCHAR(100) = NULL`:
    *   **What it does:** The name of a category.
    *   **Usage:** This parameter is **not used** in the current version of the procedure. It might be a placeholder for future functionality, like filtering the category benchmark to a specific set of categories.

### 3. Core Logic Breakdown (How it Works)

The procedure is structured as a series of `IF` blocks, one for each `@benchmark_type`.

#### a. Mode 1: Category Benchmarking (`IF @benchmark_type = 'CATEGORY'`)

This mode provides a high-level overview of the entire market, comparing categories to each other.

*   **Logic:** It groups all products by `categoryName` and calculates a rich set of performance metrics for each one:
    *   **Basic Metrics:** `total_products`, `avg_price`, `avg_rating`, `avg_reviews`.
    *   **Success Metrics:** `bestsellers` (count) and `bestseller_rate` (percentage).
    *   **Advanced Metrics:**
        *   `rating_consistency (STDDEV(stars))`: A low standard deviation means most products in that category have a similar rating, indicating a consistent customer experience. A high value means quality is highly variable.
        *   `rating_percentile (PERCENT_RANK())`: This is a powerful window function that calculates the percentile rank of each category based on its average rating. A category with a `rating_percentile` of `0.95` is rated better than 95% of all other categories.
        *   `performance_tier`: A simple `CASE` statement that buckets each category into a human-readable tier ('Top Performer', 'Average', etc.) based on its average rating.
*   **Sorting:** It sorts the results by `avg_rating` and `bestseller_rate`, bringing the most successful and highest-quality categories to the top.

#### b. Mode 2: Price Segment Benchmarking (`IF @benchmark_type = 'PRICE'`)

This mode analyzes performance based on price, regardless of category. It helps answer, "What price range generally performs best on Amazon?"

*   **Logic:** It groups all products into predefined price segments ('Budget', 'Economy', etc.) and calculates key metrics for each segment.
    *   **Segments:**
        *   `Budget (£0-25)`
        *   `Economy (£25-50)`
        *   `Mid-Range (£50-100)`
        *   `Premium (£100-200)`
        *   `Luxury (£200+)`
    *   **Metrics:** For each price segment, it calculates the `product_count`, `avg_rating`, `avg_reviews`, and `success_rate` (bestseller percentage).
*   **Sorting:** It sorts by `avg_rating` to show which price points tend to yield the highest customer satisfaction.

#### c. Mode 3: Individual Product Benchmarking (`IF @benchmark_type = 'PRODUCT'`)

This is the most granular analysis. It takes a single product (`@target_asin`) and compares it directly to the averages of its own category.

*   **Logic:** This is the most complex part, using a Common Table Expression (CTE) for clarity.
    1.  **Inner `JOIN` Query:** It first calculates the average rating, reviews, and price for **every category** and stores it in a derived table aliased as `cat`.
    2.  **The `product_benchmark` CTE:** It then joins the main `amazon_uk_products` table (aliased as `p`) with this `cat` table on `categoryName`. This join is brilliant because it attaches the category averages directly to each product row.
    3.  **Filtering:** `WHERE p.asin = @target_asin` filters this result down to just the single product you care about.
    4.  **Calculations within the CTE:**
        *   It compares the product's `stars` and `reviews` to the category averages (`avg_category_rating`, `avg_category_reviews`) to generate simple performance labels like 'Above Average' or 'Below Average'.
        *   It uses `RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY p.categoryName ...)` to calculate the product's rank based on its star rating *within its specific category*.
*   **Final `SELECT`:** It queries the CTE and presents a clean report showing the product's stats alongside the category averages, its performance labels, and its competitive rank.

### Step-by-Step Execution Flow (Product Mode Example)

Let's say you run `EXEC BenchmarkPerformance @benchmark_type = 'PRODUCT', @target_asin = 'B09B96TG33'`.

1.  **Select Mode:** The procedure's logic flows to the `IF @benchmark_type = 'PRODUCT'` block.
2.  **Calculate Category Averages:** It first runs a subquery to find the average price, stars, and reviews for every single category in the database.
3.  **Join and Filter:** It joins the target product's data with the pre-calculated averages for its specific category (e.g., 'Headphones').
4.  **Compare and Rank:**
    *   It checks if the product's 4.7 stars are higher or lower than the category average of, say, 4.2 stars, labeling it 'Above Average'.
    *   It checks if its 5,000 reviews are higher or lower than the category average of 2,500, also labeling it 'Above Average'.
    *   It calculates its rank among all other headphones based on star rating. Let's say it's the 8th best-rated headphone.
5.  **Return:** It returns a single row containing a rich profile of the product: its own stats, the category's average stats for comparison, its performance labels, and its rank (`8`), along with a final badge like 'Top 10 in Category'.
