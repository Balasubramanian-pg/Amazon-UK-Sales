### Stored Procedure 3: `GetPricingStrategy`

This procedure is a strategic analysis tool, not a simple product finder. Its purpose is to advise a seller on the **optimal pricing strategy** for a new product within a specific category. It does this by analyzing the existing market, segmenting it by price, and identifying which segments are most successful.

---

### 1. Purpose

The primary goal is to answer the strategic question: **"If I want to launch a product in this category, what price point offers the best chance of success?"** It analyzes market saturation, customer satisfaction (ratings), and proven success (bestsellers) at different price levels to provide actionable recommendations.

---

### 2. Parameters (The Controls)

*   `@category VARCHAR(100)`:
    *   **What it does:** The category you want to analyze. This is a **mandatory** parameter because pricing strategy is highly category-specific.
    *   **Default:** None. You must provide a category.

*   `@target_rating DECIMAL(3,2) = 4.0`:
    *   **What it does:** Sets the minimum average rating you consider acceptable for a market segment. It acts as your own quality bar.
    *   **Default (`4.0`):** The procedure will favor segments where the average product rating is 4.0 stars or higher.

*   `@analysis_depth VARCHAR(20) = 'STANDARD'`:
    *   **What it does:** This parameter is included in the procedure's definition but is **not actually used** in the current code. It may be a placeholder for future enhancements (e.g., a 'DEEP' analysis that includes more complex metrics).

### 3. Core Logic Breakdown (How it Works)

The procedure's logic is built using **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**, which are temporary, named result sets created with the `WITH` keyword. This makes a complex query easier to read and manage.

#### a. Step 1: Segmenting the Market (The `price_segments` CTE)

This is the main data-gathering step. It groups all products in the specified category into distinct price segments and calculates key performance indicators for each one.

*   **Segmentation Logic:**
    A `CASE` statement is used to create five price segments:
    *   `Budget`: £0 - £20
    *   `Economy`: £20.01 - £50
    *   `Mid-Range`: £50.01 - £100
    *   `Premium`: £100.01 - £200
    *   `Luxury`: Over £200

*   **Aggregation:** For each segment, it calculates:
    *   `product_count`: How many products exist in this segment? (Indicates competition/saturation).
    *   `avg_rating`: What is the average customer satisfaction in this price range?
    *   `avg_reviews`: What is the average demand/popularity?
    *   `min_price`, `max_price`, `avg_price`: The price distribution within the segment.
    *   `bestsellers`: How many products in this segment have achieved "Best Seller" status? (A key indicator of success).

#### b. Step 2: Generating Advice (The `recommendations` CTE)

This second CTE takes the aggregated data from `price_segments` and translates it into strategic advice.

*   **Key Calculations:**
    1.  **`suggested_price`**: This is simply the rounded average price from the segment, providing a concrete starting point.
    2.  **`success_rate`**:
        ```sql
        ROUND(100.0 * bestsellers / NULLIF(product_count, 0), 2)
        ```
        This is a critical metric. It calculates the percentage of products in a segment that are bestsellers. The use of `NULLIF(product_count, 0)` is a safe way to prevent a "division by zero" error if a price segment happens to have no products.

    3.  **`strategy_advice`**:
        This `CASE` statement is the core decision engine. It assigns a simple recommendation based on two factors: average rating and proven success.
        *   `'Recommended'`: The segment is a sweet spot. The average rating meets your `@target_rating` AND at least one bestseller already exists, proving success is possible.
        *   `'Consider'`: The segment has potential. The average rating is good, but no product has become a bestseller yet. This could be an untapped opportunity for a market leader.
        *   `'Avoid'`: The segment is high-risk. The average product rating is below your quality target.

#### c. Step 3: Final Output (The Final `SELECT`)

This final part of the query selects data from the `recommendations` CTE and presents it in a user-friendly format.

*   **`detailed_recommendation`**: It enhances the simple `strategy_advice` with a more descriptive sentence, explaining *why* a segment is recommended or should be avoided.
*   **Sorting (`ORDER BY`)**:
    ```sql
    ORDER BY success_rate DESC, avg_rating DESC;
    ```
    The results are sorted logically to bring the most promising strategies to the top. It prioritizes segments with the **highest success rate** first. For segments with the same success rate, it then prioritizes the one with the **higher average rating**.

### Step-by-Step Execution Flow

When you run `EXEC GetPricingStrategy @category = 'Hi-Fi Speakers'`:

1.  **Filter:** The query first selects all products from the `amazon_uk_products` table where `categoryName` is 'Hi-Fi Speakers'.
2.  **Segment & Aggregate:** It groups these speakers into the five price segments ('Budget', 'Economy', etc.) and calculates the total products, average rating, average reviews, and number of bestsellers for each group.
3.  **Analyze & Advise:** It then calculates the `success_rate` and assigns `'Recommended'`, `'Consider'`, or `'Avoid'` to each segment based on its stats and your `@target_rating`.
4.  **Format & Sort:** Finally, it formats the output with clean numbers and descriptive recommendations, then sorts the list to show you the segment with the highest chance of success at the very top.
5.  **Return:** The procedure returns a table of **price segments**, not individual products, each with a clear strategic recommendation.
