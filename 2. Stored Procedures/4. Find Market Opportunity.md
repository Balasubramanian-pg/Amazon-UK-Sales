# Stored Procedure 4: `FindMarketOpportunities`

This procedure is a high-level strategic tool designed to scan the entire product database and identify potential market niches. Unlike procedures that analyze a specific product or category, this one is about discovery. It seeks to answer the question: **"Where are the hidden opportunities in the market that I might be overlooking?"**

### 1. Purpose

The primary purpose is to find areas of **high customer demand combined with low competition**. It automates the search for market inefficiencies by identifying three distinct types of opportunities:
1.  **Market Gaps:** Entire categories that are popular but have few sellers.
2.  **Underserved Segments:** Specific price points within a category that are in high demand but lack product options.
3.  **Trending Categories:** Categories experiencing a surge in customer engagement and reviews.

### 2. Parameters (The Controls)

*   `@opportunity_type VARCHAR(20) = 'ALL'`:
    *   **What it does:** This is the main control that lets you specify which type of analysis to run.
    *   **Options:** You can choose `'GAPS'`, `'UNDERSERVED'`, `'TRENDING'`, or the default, `'ALL'`.
    *   **Default (`'ALL'`):** If you don't specify a type, the procedure will run all three analyses and return a combined set of results, with a column indicating which type of opportunity each row represents.

*   `@min_demand_threshold INT = 1000`:
    *   **What it does:** This sets a minimum threshold for what you consider "high demand." In this procedure, demand is measured by the average number of reviews a product or category receives.
    *   **Default (`1000`):** The procedure will only flag opportunities where the average product has at least 1,000 reviews, ensuring it focuses on genuinely popular markets and not obscure niches.

### 3. Core Logic Breakdown (How it Works)

The procedure is structured as a series of `IF` blocks. Depending on the `@opportunity_type` parameter, one or more of these blocks will execute.

#### a. Analysis 1: Market Gaps (`IF @opportunity_type IN ('GAPS', 'ALL')`)

This section looks for entire product categories that are popular but not yet saturated with sellers.

*   **The Goal:** Find a category where customers are actively buying and reviewing (high demand), but there are few products to choose from (low competition).
*   **The Logic:**
    1.  `WHERE reviews >= @min_demand_threshold`: It starts by considering only products that are individually very popular.
    2.  `GROUP BY categoryName`: It then groups these popular products by their category.
    3.  `HAVING COUNT(*) < 50 AND AVG(stars) >= 4.0`: This is the crucial filter. It keeps only the categories that have:
        *   Fewer than 50 highly popular products (`COUNT(*) < 50`), suggesting low competition at the top end.
        *   An average rating of 4.0 or higher (`AVG(stars) >= 4.0`), indicating customers are generally happy, so the market is viable.
*   **The Output:** Returns a row for each category that meets these criteria, with the `opportunity_type` labeled as `'MARKET_GAPS'`.

#### b. Analysis 2: Underserved Price Segments (`IF @opportunity_type IN ('UNDERSERVED', 'ALL')`)

This section drills down to a more granular level, looking for gaps within a category's pricing structure.

*   **The Goal:** Find a price point (e.g., 'Budget', 'Mid-Range') within a category that has high demand but few product offerings.
*   **The Logic:** It uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `price_analysis`.
    1.  **The CTE:** It first groups all products by *both* `categoryName` and a `price_segment` ('Budget', 'Mid-Range', 'Premium'). For each combination (e.g., "Headphones - Mid-Range"), it calculates the total `product_count` and the average demand (`avg_demand`).
    2.  **The Final Query:** It then queries the CTE results and filters for combinations where:
        *   The segment has low competition (`product_count < 100`).
        *   The segment has high demand (`avg_demand >= @min_demand_threshold`).
*   **The Output:** Returns a row for each "Category + Price Segment" combination that represents an opportunity, labeled as `'UNDERSERVED_SEGMENTS'`. This might reveal, for instance, that while the 'Premium' headphone market is saturated, the 'Budget' headphone market is popular but has very few options.

#### c. Analysis 3: Trending Categories (`IF @opportunity_type IN ('TRENDING', 'ALL')`)

This section doesn't focus on low competition but rather on identifying "hot" markets with explosive customer engagement.

*   **The Goal:** Find categories where products, on average, receive an exceptionally high number of reviews, signaling a strong market trend.
*   **The Logic:**
    1.  `GROUP BY categoryName`: It analyzes the entire market on a per-category basis.
    2.  `HAVING AVG(reviews) >= @min_demand_threshold`: This is the key. It looks for categories where the *average* product has a high number of reviews. This is a very strong signal of a highly active and engaged customer base.
    3.  It also calculates supporting metrics like `max_reviews` and the number of `high_engagement_products` (those with over 5,000 reviews) to further quantify the trend.
*   **The Output:** Returns a row for each "hot" category, labeled as `'TRENDING_CATEGORIES'`. This is useful for sellers who want to "ride a wave" of popularity.

### Step-by-Step Execution Flow

When you run `EXEC FindMarketOpportunities` with the default settings:

1.  **Check 1 (Gaps):** The procedure runs the first analysis, looking for categories with few top-performing products but high ratings. It stores any matching categories.
2.  **Check 2 (Underserved):** It then runs the second analysis, breaking down every category into price segments and looking for a high-demand, low-competition combination. It stores any matches.
3.  **Check 3 (Trending):** Finally, it runs the third analysis, identifying categories where the average review count is exceptionally high. It stores these as well.
4.  **Return:** The procedure returns a **combined list** of all opportunities found across the three checks. The `opportunity_type` column clearly tells you which type of opportunity each row represents, giving you a comprehensive report on potential market entry points.
