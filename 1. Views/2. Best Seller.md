# View 2: `bestseller_intelligence`

This view is a powerful strategic analysis tool. Instead of looking at individual products, it aggregates data to the category level to provide a "blueprint" for what it takes to succeed in different market segments.

### 1. Purpose

The primary purpose of this view is to **decode the formula for success** within each product category. It analyzes the characteristics of products that have achieved "Best Seller" status and compares them to the category as a whole.

It is designed to answer strategic business questions like:
*   "What is the average price point of a bestseller in the 'Headphones' category?"
*   "In which categories is it easiest or hardest to become a bestseller?"
*   "What is the typical star rating and review count of a successful product in a market I want to enter?"

### 2. Core Logic Breakdown (How it Works)

The view aggregates the entire `amazon_uk_products` table by category and calculates several key performance indicators related to bestsellers.

#### a. The `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` Clauses (The Scope)

*   **`GROUP BY categoryName`:** This is the core of the view. It collapses all individual products into a single summary row for each unique `categoryName`. The entire analysis is performed at the category level.
*   **`HAVING COUNT(*) >= 10`:** This is a crucial data quality filter. It ensures that the analysis is only performed on categories that have at least 10 products. This prevents the results from being skewed by very small, niche categories where the data might not be statistically significant.

#### b. The Calculated Columns (The Intelligence)

This is where the view derives its powerful insights by comparing bestsellers to the general population of products.

1.  **`total_products` & `bestseller_count`:**
    *   These are simple counts providing the basic context of how many products and how many bestsellers exist in the category.

2.  **`avg_bestseller_price`, `avg_bestseller_rating`, `avg_bestseller_reviews`:**
    ```sql
    ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN isBestSeller = 1 THEN price ELSE NULL END), 2) AS avg_bestseller_price
    ```
    *   **What it does:** This is a clever and powerful SQL pattern known as a **conditional average**.
    *   **How it works:** The `CASE` statement evaluates each product. If it's a bestseller (`isBestSeller = 1`), it passes its `price` to the `AVG` function. If it's not, it passes `NULL`. The `AVG` function automatically ignores `NULL` values in its calculation.
    *   **Why it's useful:** The result is the average price (or rating, or review count) of **only the bestselling products** in that category. This creates the "bestseller profile" for the category.

3.  **`bestseller_percentage`:**
    ```sql
    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN isBestSeller = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) AS bestseller_percentage
    ```
    *   **What it does:** It calculates the percentage of products in the category that have achieved bestseller status.
    *   **Why it's useful:** This is perhaps the most important metric for comparing categories. A high percentage means it's a category where many products can succeed, or a few sellers dominate with many bestselling products. A low percentage indicates a highly competitive market where achieving bestseller status is rare and difficult. The `100.0` is used to ensure the division results in a decimal value for an accurate percentage.

### 3. How It's Used

Once created, this view provides a high-level strategic dashboard.

**Example Query 1: Find the 5 categories where it's "easiest" to become a bestseller.**
```sql
SELECT
    categoryName,
    bestseller_percentage,
    total_products
FROM
    bestseller_intelligence
ORDER BY
    bestseller_percentage DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
This would show categories with the highest rate of bestsellers, which could indicate less competition or high market demand.

**Example Query 2: Get the success profile for launching a new "Hi-Fi Speaker".**
```sql
SELECT
    avg_bestseller_price,
    avg_bestseller_rating,
    avg_bestseller_reviews
FROM
    bestseller_intelligence
WHERE
    categoryName = 'Hi-Fi Speakers';
```
The result of this query gives you a clear target: "To be a successful Hi-Fi Speaker, I should aim for a price around Â£X, a rating of Y stars, and be prepared to generate around Z reviews."
