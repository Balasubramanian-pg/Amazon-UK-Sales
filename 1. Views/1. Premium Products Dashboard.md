# View 1: `premium_products_dashboard`

A `VIEW` in SQL is a stored query that acts like a virtual table. It simplifies complex queries and allows you to create a reusable, logical representation of your data. This specific view is designed to create an at-a-glance dashboard focused exclusively on the premium end of the market.

### 1. Purpose

The primary purpose of this view is to **identify and categorize premium products** based on a combination of price and customer satisfaction (star rating). It creates a simplified, high-level summary that allows business analysts, marketers, or product managers to quickly analyze the top-tier products without writing complex queries each time.

Think of it as a pre-built filter for the "luxury" or "high-quality" segment of your product catalog, enriched with insightful new metrics.

### 2. Core Logic Breakdown (How it Works)

The view selects data from the base `amazon_uk_products` table and transforms it by adding three new, calculated columns.

#### a. The `WHERE` Clause (The Foundation)

```sql
WHERE price > 0 AND stars > 0;
```
This is a crucial data-cleansing step. It ensures that the dashboard is only built using products that have a valid price and have received at least one rating. This prevents potential errors (like dividing by zero) and removes incomplete or irrelevant data from the analysis.

#### b. The Calculated Columns (The Insights)

This is where the view adds its real value.

1.  **`product_tier`**
    ```sql
    CASE
        WHEN price >= 100 AND stars >= 4.5 THEN 'Premium Elite'
        WHEN price >= 50 AND stars >= 4.0 THEN 'Premium Standard'
        WHEN price >= 25 AND stars >= 3.5 THEN 'Mid-Range Premium'
        ELSE 'Budget'
    END AS product_tier
    ```
    *   **What it does:** This `CASE` statement creates a new classification system. It's more sophisticated than just looking at price because it requires a minimum quality level (`stars`) to be considered "premium."
    *   **Why it's useful:** It segments the market into meaningful tiers. 'Premium Elite' products aren't just expensive; they are also highly loved by customers. This helps identify the true top-performers.

2.  **`engagement_score`**
    ```sql
    ROUND(reviews * stars, 2) AS engagement_score
    ```
    *   **What it does:** It creates a score that combines a product's popularity (`reviews`) with its quality (`stars`).
    *   **Why it's useful:** This score provides a more balanced view of a product's success than looking at reviews alone. A product with 500 reviews and a 4.8-star rating (`engagement_score` = 2400) is arguably more "successful" in a premium context than a product with 1000 reviews and a 3.5-star rating (`engagement_score` = 3500) that just happens to be popular. It's a quality-weighted popularity metric.

3.  **`price_per_star_ratio`**
    ```sql
    ROUND(price / NULLIF(stars, 0), 2) AS price_per_star_ratio
    ```
    *   **What it does:** It calculates the cost of a single "star" of quality for each product.
    *   **Why it's useful:** This is a powerful value metric. A **lower** number indicates better value for money (you pay less for each point of quality). This can help identify products that are perceived as a great deal for their quality level, or conversely, those that are overpriced relative to their rating. The `NULLIF(stars, 0)` is a safety check to prevent a division-by-zero error.

### 3. How It's Used

Once created, you can query this view just like a regular table.

**Example Query 1: Find the top 10 "Premium Elite" products with the best engagement.**
```sql
SELECT
    title,
    price,
    engagement_score
FROM
    premium_products_dashboard
WHERE
    product_tier = 'Premium Elite'
ORDER BY
    engagement_score DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Example Query 2: Find the best "value" among "Premium Standard" products.**
```sql
-- A lower price_per_star_ratio is better
SELECT
    title,
    price,
    stars,
    price_per_star_ratio
FROM
    premium_products_dashboard
WHERE
    product_tier = 'Premium Standard'
ORDER BY
    price_per_star_ratio ASC
LIMIT 10;
```
