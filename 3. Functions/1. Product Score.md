# **Function 1: `CalculateProductScore` - Detailed Explanation**  

## **Purpose**  
This function generates a **comprehensive performance score (0-100)** for Amazon products by combining multiple key metrics:  
- **Star ratings** (customer satisfaction)  
- **Review count** (popularity & engagement)  
- **Price competitiveness** (value for money)  
- **Best-seller status** (market dominance)  

It helps businesses **quickly compare products**, identify top performers, and make data-driven decisions.

## **Key Components & Calculation**  
The score is a **weighted combination** of four normalized metrics:  

### **1. Rating Component (40% Weight)**  
- Normalizes the **star rating (0-5)** to a **0-1 scale** (e.g., 4.5 stars → `4.5 / 5 = 0.9`).  
- Higher ratings contribute more to the score.  

### **2. Review Component (30% Weight)**  
- Uses **logarithmic scaling** to handle large review counts (e.g., 10,000 reviews → `log(10000) ≈ 4`).  
- Prevents products with extremely high reviews from dominating unfairly.  

### **3. Value Score (20% Weight)**  
- Measures **"bang for the buck"** by comparing rating vs. price.  
- Formula: `(stars / √price)` (higher ratings at lower prices score better).  
- Capped at **1.0** to avoid extreme values.  

### **4. Best-Seller Bonus (10% Weight)**  
- If the product is a **best-seller**, it gets a **full 10% boost**.  
- If not, this component contributes **0**.

## **Example Calculation**  
Let’s calculate the score for:  
- **Stars:** 4.5  
- **Reviews:** 5,000  
- **Price:** £30  
- **Best-seller:** ✅ (Yes)  

### **Step 1: Normalize Rating**  
`4.5 / 5 = 0.9` → `0.9 * 40% = 36`  

### **Step 2: Normalize Reviews (Log Scale)**  
`LOG(5000 + 1) / LOG(100000) ≈ 0.74` → `0.74 * 30% = 22.2`  

### **Step 3: Calculate Value Score**  
`(4.5 / √30) ≈ 0.82` (capped at 1.0) → `0.82 * 20% = 16.4`  

### **Step 4: Best-Seller Bonus**  
`1.0 * 10% = 10`  

### **Final Score**  
`36 (Rating) + 22.2 (Reviews) + 16.4 (Value) + 10 (Best-seller) = **84.6**`

## **Business Applications**  
1. **Product Ranking** – Compare products across categories.  
2. **Inventory Decisions** – Prioritize high-scoring products.  
3. **Pricing Strategy** – Adjust prices to improve the "value" component.  
4. **Marketing Focus** – Promote best-sellers and high-rated products.  

### **SQL Usage Example**  
```sql
SELECT 
    product_name,
    stars,
    reviews,
    price,
    dbo.CalculateProductScore(stars, reviews, price, isBestSeller) AS product_score
FROM amazon_products
ORDER BY product_score DESC;
```
**Output:** A ranked list of products by performance.

## **Why This Matters**  
- **Standardizes comparisons** (e.g., a 4.5-star £50 product vs. a 4.0-star £20 product).  
- **Encapsulates multiple success factors** (not just sales volume).  
- **Helps spot hidden gems** (e.g., moderately priced, high-rated products).
