# **Function 5: `CalculateTrendMomentum` - Predictive Performance Engine**

## **Core Innovation**
This function quantifies **future sales potential** by analyzing:
- **Velocity Signals** (review growth rate)
- **Quality Signals** (rating stability)
- **Market Forces** (category trends, price elasticity)
- **Social Proof** (bestseller status)

Outputs a **0-150 momentum score** that predicts which products will grow vs. decline.

## **The Momentum Algorithm Breakdown**

### **1. Review Velocity (35% Weight)**
Measures **demand acceleration** through review volume tiers:

| Reviews | Score | Interpretation |
|---------|-------|----------------|
| 50,000+ | 100 | Viral hit |

| 10,000-19,999 | 80 | Gaining traction |
| 5,000-9,999 | 70 | Emerging |
| 1,000-4,999 | 60 | Steady |

*Example:* A product jumping from 2,000 to 8,000 reviews in a month signals breakout potential.

### **2. Rating Quality (30% Weight)**

| 4.3-4.49 | 80 | Trust builder |
| 4.0-4.29 | 70 | Market standard |
| ≤3.9 | 50 | Risk signal |

*Key Insight:* Products maintaining ≥4.5 during review surges have superior retention.

## **Real-World Prediction Scenarios**

### **Case 1: The Breakout Product**
- Wireless Earbuds  
- Reviews: 12,000 (80 pts)  
- Stars: 4.8 (100 pts)  
- Price: £45 (100 pts)  
- Bestseller: Yes (+20%)  
- Category: Electronics (+10%)  
- **Raw Score:** (80*0.35)+(100*0.3)+(100*0.2)= 28+30+20 = 78  
- **With Boosts:** 78 * 1.3 = **101.4**

- Stars: 4.1 (70 pts)  
- Price: £89 (70 pts)  
- Bestseller: No  
- **Score:** (70*0.35)+(70*0.3)+(70*0.2) = **70**  
- *Prediction:* Likely to decline as cheaper 4.5+ alternatives emerge  

### **Case 3: The Steady Performer**
- Kitchen Scale  
- Reviews: 15,000 (80 pts)  
- Stars: 4.5 (90 pts)

## **Strategic Applications**

### **1. Inventory Forecasting**
```sql
SELECT product_name,
       dbo.CalculateTrendMomentum(asin,stars,reviews,price,isBestSeller,category) AS momentum
FROM products
WHERE momentum > 100
ORDER BY momentum DESC
```
→ Stock more high-momentum products  

### **2. Marketing Budget Allocation**
```sql
SELECT 
   campaign_id,
   AVG(dbo.CalculateTrendMomentum(asin,stars,reviews,price,isBestSeller,category)) AS avg_momentum
FROM promoted_products
GROUP BY campaign_id
```
→ Double down on campaigns with momentum >90  

### **3. Supplier Performance**
```sql
SELECT 
   supplier,
   COUNT(CASE WHEN momentum > 90 THEN 1 END) AS high_momentum_products
FROM products
GROUP BY supplier
ORDER BY high_momentum_products DESC
```
→ Identify suppliers producing trending items

## **Why This Beats Sales Data Alone**
1. **Leading Indicator:** Momentum peaks **before** sales spikes  
2. **Early Warning:** Score drops predict inventory gluts  
3. **Market-Aware:** Adjusts for category seasonality  
4. **Platform-Optimized:** Amazon-specific consumer behavior
