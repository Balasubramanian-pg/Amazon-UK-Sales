# **Function 2: `GetMarketPosition` - Detailed Explanation**  

## **Purpose**  
This function **classifies a product’s competitive position** in the market based on:  
- **Price** (compared to category average)  
- **Star rating** (compared to category average)  

It outputs a **strategic label** (e.g., *"Premium Leader"*, *"Budget Option"*) to help businesses understand where their product stands.

## **How It Works**  
### **1. Input Parameters**  
| Parameter | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `@product_asin` | Amazon product ID | `B08N5KWB9H` |
| `@category` | Product category | `"Electronics"` |
| `@price` | Current price | `59.99` |
| `@stars` | Avg. star rating (1-5) | `4.5` |

### **2. Key Calculations**  
The function:  
1. **Fetches category averages** (avg. price & rating).  
2. **Compares the product’s price & rating** to category norms.  
3. **Assigns a market position** based on predefined rules.  

#### **Price & Rating Ratios**  
- **Price Ratio** = `(Product Price) / (Category Avg. Price)`  
  - *Example:* If the product is £60 and the category average is £50 → `60/50 = 1.2`  
- **Rating Ratio** = `(Product Stars) / (Category Avg. Stars)`  
  - *Example:* If the product has 4.5 stars and the category average is 4.0 → `4.5/4.0 = 1.125`

## **Market Position Classifications**  
The function uses **thresholds** to determine positioning:  

| **Position Label**       | **Condition** |
|--------------------------|---------------|
| **"Value Leader"**       | High rating (`≥1.1×` avg) + Low price (`≤0.9×` avg) |
| **"Premium Leader"**     | High rating (`≥1.1×` avg) + High price (`≥1.1×` avg) |
| **"Quality Leader"**     | Slightly high rating (`≥1.05×` avg) + Fair price (`0.9-1.1×` avg) |
| **"Budget Option"**      | Low rating (`≤0.95×` avg) + Low price (`≤0.9×` avg) |
| **"Overpriced"**         | Low rating (`≤0.95×` avg) + High price (`≥1.1×` avg) |
| **"Premium Positioned"** | Very high price (`≥1.2×` avg) |
| **"Budget Positioned"**  | Very low price (`≤0.8×` avg) |
| **"Market Follower"**    | Everything else (neutral positioning) |

## **Example Calculation**  
**Product:** Wireless Earbuds  
- **Price:** £60 (Category avg: £50 → `60/50 = 1.2`)  
- **Stars:** 4.5 (Category avg: 4.0 → `4.5/4.0 = 1.125`)  

### **Analysis:**  
- **Rating Ratio (1.125) > 1.1** → High rating  
- **Price Ratio (1.2) > 1.1** → High price  

### **Result:**  
**"Premium Leader"** (High rating + High price)  

---

## **Business Applications**  
1. **Pricing Strategy**  
   - Should you raise/lower the price? (E.g., "Overpriced" products may need discounts.)  
2. **Marketing Messaging**  
   - "Value Leader" → Promote as *"Top-rated at a great price!"*  
   - "Premium Leader" → Market as *"Luxury choice for best performance."*  
3. **Competitive Analysis**  
   - Identify gaps (e.g., few "Quality Leader" products in a category).  

### **SQL Usage Example**  
```sql
SELECT 
    product_name,
    price,
    stars,
    dbo.GetMarketPosition(asin, category, price, stars) AS market_position
FROM amazon_products
WHERE category = 'Electronics';
```
**Output:**  
| Product Name       | Price | Stars | Market Position    |
|--------------------|-------|-------|--------------------|
| Premium Headphones | £120  | 4.7   | **Premium Leader** |
| Budget Earbuds     | £25   | 3.8   | **Budget Option**  |

## **Why This Matters**  
- **Avoids guesswork** in competitive positioning.  
- **Helps optimize pricing** (e.g., "Market Follower" products may need adjustments).  
- **Guides marketing & promotions** (e.g., push "Value Leaders" more aggressively).
